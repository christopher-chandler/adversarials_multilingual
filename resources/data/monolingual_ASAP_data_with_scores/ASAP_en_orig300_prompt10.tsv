en_025954	10	0	light gray ::  The darker of color the , the hoter it g ets
en_025957	10	1	light gray :: i chose light gray because i was thinking of temperatures of the seasons. in summer the light gray will reflect some o f the heat while keeping it alittle warm inside, in winter the ligh t gray will absorb alittle of the sun light making it alittle warm inside .
en_025962	10	1	white :: it will give the dog more cool air because li ghter colors absorb cool air instead of heat
en_025971	10	2	white ::  The best color to paint the dog house would b e white. White reflects more light than black. This would keep the inside temperature of the dog house cooler than it would if the dog house were painted black. In the experiment, the white lid was at an average of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefore, the white would be the bes t color to paint the dog house.
en_025972	10	1	light gray :: the doghouse should be light gray because it does not absorb to much heat or to little heat so the dog won't be to hot or to cold it will be just right
en_025979	10	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use because it would not be too hot inside. If you were to do black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat. In every trial for dark gray it created 48(DEG)C. This seems like a pretty good temperature for a dog house.
en_025980	10	1	black :: Black is my choice because if it kept the jar warm for ten minutes then black would be able to keep a doghouse warm for longer.
en_025981	10	0	black ::  I chose black because the sun wont reflect th e color black and it wont effect inside the dog house.
en_025990	10	0	light gray ::  I chose light gray becasue it won't make the dog feel sad.
en_025992	10	2	white :: white will keep the dog house nice and cool s ince according to there data the white lid kept the air in the jar cooles t.
en_025998	10	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghous e because it would keep the dog cooler. White would absorb less solar and thermal energy, therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse. In the experiment, the air temperature in the jar with the white lid aver aged 42(DEG) C, while the black lid jar averaged 53(DEG) C. The light g ray lid produced and air temperature of 45(DEG) C and the dark gray lid made the air temperature in the jar 48(DEG) C.
en_026005	10	1	white ::  the white colored paint might make the inside o the dog house colder than out side on a hot day s ohe or she dont get way to hot.
en_026010	10	1	dark gray :: I chose a darker color like dark gray, becasu e it will absorb more energy so the dog will hopefully much warmer in the winter. However, another reason I chose a dark gray instead of black is that it's also lighter in color compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot in the summer.
en_026012	10	2	light gray ::  This would affect the doghouse because some l ight would be attracted to the house but not too much. In their experimen t the light gray lids tempature was 45(DEG). This would be a good tempat ure for the dog house because in the summer the dog would have enough sha de so that it would not over heat, but in the winter it would be warm eno ugh so that the dog would not be cold.
en_026021	10	2	white :: It might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse. The data shows that the white lid has the lowest temperature, the refore making it the best color to build the doghouse with.
en_026032	10	1	white :: The color of the dog house being white wil ca use the doghouse to stay cooler under sunlight. This is beacuse the color white reflects the light away from the doghouse, and the light will not be absorbed and turned into heat energy inside the doghouse.
en_026038	10	2	black :: the best paint color for the house would be b lack because it would keep the dog warmer than other colors would. the bl ack lid was 53(DEG), and all others were between 42 and 48(DEG)
en_026040	10	1	white :: The color black tends to make things hotter a nd so if u used a white lid it would keep the tempature down if it was a sunny day. For the black lid in the experiment the tempature increased( t emp:54) and for the white it decresed(temp:42). This is because the energ y is sucked out from the dark colors. Also dogs have alot of fur so it wo uld be best to have a cooler house.
en_026045	10	0	black :: it might blow it up
en_026057	10	2	white :: How the white paint will affect the dog house is it wont absorb so much heat, so the dog wont be as hot. If Brandi an d Jerry were to choose black paint it will absorb all the heat because in the experiment in trial one its ((DEG)C) was 54, in trial two its ((DEG) C) were 52, in trial 3 its ((DEG)C) were 54 and the average is 53. So these re sults show that the doghouse will contstanly be warm so this will not mak e the dog comfortable with all the heat. While the white lid in the exper iment had very low temperatures its ((DEG)C) were 42,43,41 and its avera ge came to 42 ((DEG)C) so this shows that the white will absorb barley a ny heat.
en_026069	10	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house by heating it up because black absorbes more energy.
en_026076	10	2	light gray :: brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse L IGHT GREY because the dor wouldnt get to hot because his dog houdse is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with a very light color so t hat is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and i ts not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45(DEG) and for black it was 53(DEG) a nd dark grey 48(DEG) and for white was 42(DEG) light grey is the averag e of them all, 53 ( black) - 48 (dark grey) = 5 53 (black) - 45 ( light grey) = 8 and 53 (black) -42 ( white) = 11 light grey (8) is i n the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the color they should pain t the dog house.
en_026087	10	2	white :: brandi and jerry would want to paint th e dog house light gray. painting the dog house light gray would be the b est paint to color the bog house because in the experiment they had foun d out that, painting the house black absorbs more heat energy, and pain ting it white will not absorb enoff energy, so in the middle will be the best for the dog. so not too much thermal energy, but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best.
en_026093	10	1	"white :: Well the color ""white"" makes it so that inside of the doghouse would be more cooler because the sun reflects off white and it wont be as hot inside the doghouse."
en_026094	10	1	white ::  i chose white because the darker colors absorb more heat energy that the lighter colors
en_026097	10	2	black :: if the doghouse is black then it will be warm er. i know this because the jar with the black lid h ad an average temperature of 53(DEG)c
en_026098	10	2	white :: The color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature . On average , the color black is 53(DEG)C , dark gre y is 48(DEG)C, light grey is 45(DEG)C, and white is 42(DEG)C .
en_026099	10	1	black :: this color will keep the inside of the dog ho use warm during winter because dark color absorbs more heat energy.
en_026105	10	2	white :: White. It is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the lowest average temperature rise of 18(DEG) C. In the experiment, the starting temperature of was 24(DEG) C and after ten minutes under a lamp, the air inside the jar increased by 18(DEG) C. To tal of 42(DEG) C. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it will not be suitable for the doghouse because the average temperature rise wo uld be too high.
en_026109	10	1	white :: The white paint would keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the sun, because it reflects the most energy, therefore having the lowest internal temperature.
en_026123	10	0	black :: The color may affect it by the temperature of the air may be cooler than the other colors
en_026124	10	1	white :: the white color will attract less energy than the others, thus making the doghouse cooler
en_026132	10	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best choice, because you don't want the dog house to cold, but you dont want it to warm. And the average temperature for the light gray was 45(DEG)C which is just right for a dog, because you don't want your dog to get to hot. And the black wouldn't be a good color, because darker colors absorb more energy. And there was an eight degree difference between the black lid and the light grey lid, making the light grey lid, the cooler, better choice.
en_026133	10	2	white :: White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat. The experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat, so it will keep the doghouse cooler.
en_026135	10	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray will make the dog house a bit warme r. The data states that it is 48(DEG) C always.
en_026147	10	1	white :: The color will heat up the doghouse to about 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This is the best color to choose, because the bl ack heated up to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. Therefore, the temperature of t he white jar was 9(DEG)C lower than the black jar, making the white cool er.
en_026150	10	2	white ::  Choosing the lightest shade (white) is the be st colour to paint a dog house because in order to create an environment most comfortable for the dog year round, the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. Painting the hosue white will ensure that it st ays as cool as it can over summer, thus making it the most comfortable fo r the dog. The white house will remain coolest because as according to th e data collected, the average temperature will be aprox. 42(DEG) C, whil e for the other colours they reached much greater temperatures (45(DEG) LGray, 48(DEG) DGray, 53(DEG) Black). The white colour was 11(DEG) coo ler than the darkest colour (black), thus making it the best colour to pa int a dog house.
en_026153	10	0	black :: cAUSE HE MIGHT NOT WAMT TO SLEEP IN THE DOGHO USE CAUSE OF THE COLOR OF IT AND IT MIGHT ALSO MESS THE DOGS EYES UP TO T HAT COULD ALSO BE IT IN THIS EXPERIMENT
en_026155	10	1	black ::  painting the doghouse black might affect it b y attracting all the heat to it and might cause the dog to have a heat st roke while is laying inside.
en_026165	10	1	dark gray :: Dark grey is best because in the winter the d oghouse will absorbe heat. Also in the summer the doghouse will not absor be too much heat. like if it was black.
en_026171	10	2	black ::  I think black would be the best color for the doghouse. It will atract more heat inside the doghouse than any other color because in the experiment with the jars, the black lid jar had the warmest inside temperature. This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out. When it is warm outside and the dog gets hot, it can sleep outside.
en_026179	10	2	black :: Black would be the best color, because it wou ld keep the house warmer. In the experiment, black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar (53(DEG)C)
en_026180	10	2	light gray ::  It would absorb a little amount of heat for t he summer time when it's hot. But because it's also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter. I know this because the black lid abso rbed the most heat and the white lid absorbed the least heat.
en_026184	10	0	black :: that color would affect the doghouse because it would be too dark in the inside and dogs dont have eye color so it wo uld be hard for the dog to see. it also takes way longer to dry then the other colors the other colors dryed in the 40's but the black color dryed in the 50 i would not recomend them to color it black
en_026193	10	2	black :: black because it well make the dog hous e warmer and the results to the black colr is saying it warmer.
en_026196	10	2	white ::  how the white might affect the doghouse is be cause it will be alot cooler than the other dark colors because the avera ge temperature of the darker colors are more then whites
en_026214	10	1	dark gray :: dark grey would be good because it wont get t o hot or to cold for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 4 8(DEG)c
en_026216	10	1	white ::  it will make it less hotter for the dog
en_026217	10	1	black :: if it was color black it would make the dog h ouse hot.
en_026220	10	1	black ::  If you paint the doghouse black, the inside o f the doghouse would be warmer than if you painted the doghouse a lighter colour such as light grey or white.
en_026226	10	2	black ::  By painting the doghouse black, the air insid e the doghouse will be warmer than if the doghouse was another color. In the experiment, the air from the jar with the black colored lid was 53(DEG) , which is 2(DEG) higher than the dark grey lid, 8(DEG) higher than the light grey lid, and 11(DEG) higher than the white lids air temperature. This shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it.
en_026229	10	1	dark gray :: dark gray may attract more heat to the dog ho use but no as much as black.
en_026230	10	2	dark gray :: The best color for the doghouse is dark gray because it won't be so dark that it will overheat the inside of the dogho use and it will also retain it's temperature longer through out the night . The dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48(DEG). That i s better than the 53(DEG) average for the black and the 45(DEG) a verage for light gray because it will not be way too warm but it will ret ain it's heat.
en_026239	10	1	black :: if a dog house was painted black, then the do g house would stay warmer inside because the experiment shows that the ai r temprature in a glass jar with a black lid on it had the warmest air te mprature of 53, 54, and 52.
en_026240	10	2	white :: This color will keep the dog house rather coo l that way the dog will not over heat itself. In the experiment, lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature.
en_026246	10	2	dark gray :: The dark grey would keep the doghouse warm, b ut not too hot. This is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the se cond warmest color.
en_026252	10	2	white ::  They should use the white color because white doesn't heat up as fast. After 10 minutes, white's tempature was 42(DEG) while black's was 53(DEG). That is an 11(DEG) difference. So the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white.
en_026253	10	2	white :: The color white is best for the doghouse beca use the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air t empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white h ad an average of 42(DEG)C which means that the increase of air was coole r . So the color white will affect the doghouse by the increase of air fl ow and be cooler then any other color.
en_026254	10	2	white ::  The white dog house would not attract as much heat as the darker colors, so if they want to keep their dog at a cool t emperature, then they should go with the white color. The average tempera ture for the black colored jar is 53(DEG) C. The average temperature for the white colored jar is 42(DEG) C. The black lided jar is 11(DEG) C h igher than the white lided jar.
en_026262	10	2	white :: The white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse. In the data Brandi and Jerry collected, white had t he lowest temperature average of 42(DEG)C. The next coolest was light gr ey with an average of 45(DEG)C, dark grey with an average of 48(DEG)C a nd the hottest was black with an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore white pa int will make the doghouse the coolest.
en_026272	10	2	black :: The inside of the doghouse would most likely be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the sunlight, therefore it would become hot on the inside. Results from the experiment are that the black lid had a high of 54 degrees celcius and that is higher than the rest of the colors.
en_026291	10	2	black :: The other colors had between 40(DEG) and 50(DEG) but black is hotter then the other colors.
en_026293	10	2	white :: White, because white reflects the sun and the doghouse wont get hot like it would if you use black. In your data it sh ows that in the trials white will be the least hot color.
en_026294	10	1	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because the darker the colo r, the more heat it attracts. For example, during the winter, the dog ins ide the doghouse might get cold, so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside. But sometimes the dog might not want so much heat, so i picked dark gray instead of black. Also, another example is in the summer time, if the dog doesnt want to go outside, and stays in the doghouse, he doesnt have to be so hot. But he can also go o utside if the doghouse is to warm.
en_026296	10	2	white :: using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day. the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the average temperature of the blace lid was 53(DEG)C, the white lid was 11(DEG)C cooler then the jar with the blac k lid
en_026298	10	2	black :: Using a black paint color for the doghouse wi ll make the doghouse nice and warm for a dog during the cold seasons when a doghouse is needed the most. Due to the data, a black lid color had an average of 53(DEG)C. That will affect the doghouse by making the doghou se much more warmer in temperature. A white lid only had an average of 42 (DEG)C, making it too cold for the dog. That's why a black doghouse is b est for a doghouse to keep the dog warm.
en_026308	10	0	black :: Black Will Efect The Dog House Alot In The Su mmer Because Balck Is An Energy Color.
en_026309	10	1	white ::  This color will affect the doghouse by making it colder. If they live in a hot place this would be the best color to c hoose from.
en_026311	10	2	dark gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be dark gray because it will wont get to hot or to cold in the dog house for the dog. I know this because in the results the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees C after 10 minutes of being under the lamp.
en_026316	10	2	black :: The paint color will help to keep the dog war m becuse in the results of the experiment the black lid heated up faster.
en_026320	10	2	white :: White would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer. the average temperature of the white-lid-jar was 42(DEG), while the averge temperature of the black-lid-jar was 53(DEG). the white was 11(DEG) cooler, so if the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer.
en_026332	10	2	white :: I chose white because the white paint color d oesn't abosorb that much energy than the other colors and also the air te mperature inside wouldn't be as high as the other colors. So if the white doghouse was placed under the sun and the starting temperature would be 24(DEG)C the average temperature would only rise up to 42(DEG)C. But if the color of the doghouse was black or gray than the temperature would b e in the 45(DEG)C - 53(DEG)C. So white doghouse would be a great pick f or the color of the doghouse.
en_026346	10	1	black ::  It might affect the doghouse because it obesv ers heat energy with a darker color.
en_026351	10	2	white :: White would be the best color for the dog hou se because in the experiment the data in the chart shows that white kept the coolest temperature of 41(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest t emperaturee of 44(DEG)C, dark gray had the second hottest temperature of 48(DEG)C, and black had the hottest temperature of 54(DEG)C.
en_026353	10	1	light gray :: the color light gray will heat the dog house but it wont over heat it and it will not under heat it either.
en_026369	10	1	white :: i would paint it white, that way, showing fro m the table, the tempurature wouldnt get so hot.
en_026370	10	2	light gray ::  The color light gray would be the best paint for the doghouse. During the experiment, light grey had an average of 48(DEG)c, compared to black whos average was 53(DEG)c and white whos was 42(DEG)c. Light grey would affect the doghouse becasue it is a color that soaks up heat but not so much that it would overheat the doghouse.
en_026372	10	2	white ::  The dog house will remain cooler in the summe r. The white lid only had an average of 42(DEG)C in the jar, while the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C in the jar.
en_026373	10	1	dark gray :: This color would keep the doghouse warmer dur ing the winter and hotter during the summer. Therefore, this would be a g ood paint color for the doghouse. I know this because in the experiment t hey did, the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar wa s around 45(DEG), while the darkest colored lid was hotter, and the ligh test was cooler.
en_026383	10	2	black :: Black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most. Black, based on the experim ent, was able to absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids . For example, in trial 1, black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius. Light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius. Evident ly, black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors.
en_026384	10	1	white :: White becase the doghouse wont get to hot for the dog and the temurature will be at a low risk for the dog to get heat stroke.
en_026386	10	1	black ::  This color will make the doghouse absorb more light. Because it is black, heat will absorb on this faster then dark gr ay, light gray, or white.
en_026387	10	2	white ::  If they use white the doghouse will be cooler than if they used black because the average temperature inside the jar w as 42(DEG)C for a white lid and 53(DEG)C for a black lid.
en_026389	10	1	white :: The white dog house can help the dog cool off and it keeps it cooller in the Dog house unlike Black and the darker colors that abosorb, The heat and then so warm the dogHouse and There by inc reasing the Tem(DEG)
en_026390	10	1	white ::  white because that color doesnt absorbs enery and the doghouse be cooler
en_026392	10	1	black :: if its black the doghouse might cunduct more heat but if you choose a lighter color it will not atract as much heat as the dark color.
en_026393	10	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun. White would be best because it will absorb the least energy, keeping the temp down, in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53, while the white color was 42, and 11(DEG) difference.
en_026398	10	0	light gray :: This color should make the doghouse a nice co ol temperature cosistantly. I say this because in the data table light gr ay's average temp. was 45(DEG).
en_026401	10	2	white ::  white would affect the color by not letting the dog house heat up because with the data the result was, the darker the color the more heat so the color white would keep the dog house nice and fresh.
en_026408	10	0	dark gray :: The greater the increase in the air temperatu re in the glass jar , because darker colors absorb more energy.
en_026416	10	2	white :: In the testing of which color made the air in side of the jar hottest, the black was the hottest, then came the dark gr ay, than light grey, then the white was the coolest so the air inside of the doghouse would be cooler if it was white which would be best for the dog.
en_026418	10	0	white ::  dark colors atract heat lighter colors reapel heat
en_026427	10	0	black :: i think black would be the best color because when it was in the glass bottle after 10 minutes it had the highest scor es.
en_026440	10	1	white ::  Having a white color for the dog house will effectively keep the dog at a temperature where the sun wouldn't gradually increase the temperature too hot for the dog to live inside dog house. According to a experiment on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar, a white lid did not help increase the temperature inside the jar. While a grey and black lids effectively increased the temperture over 6 degrees.

en_026567	10	2	white ::  white will keep the doghouse cooler, because it will be only 42(DEG)c inside, then if Brandi and Jerry were to use black it would be 54(DEG)c inside of the doghouse because black absobes light, and white reflects the light so the heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse.
en_026571	10	0	white :: The color of the dog house affected the temperature inside.
en_026572	10	2	white ::  I would chose white, because that will make it the coldest and if i were a dog i wouldnt want it to be really hot, id want it to be as cold as i could get it. for black the average was the wa rmest with 53(DEG)C, for dark gray it was in the middle with 48(DEG)C, for light gray it was also in the middle with 45(DEG)C, and white was the coldest wtih 42(DEG)C. The white paint will keep the doghouse less insul ated, and more open. it will keep it so its not so hot and not so cold be cause 42(DEG)C isnt cold or hot its in the middle.
en_026592	10	1	white ::  I think the color for the doghouse should be the color white because it doesnt attract heat and if we were to choose the black color inside the doghouse it would be hot .The black color's average is 53 and the white colors average is 42.
en_026593	10	0	black :: becouse the dog house would look filthy
en_026594	10	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house and make it h otter, because black atracts the sun
en_026608	10	1	white ::  white paint color because that way the dog wo nt be hot instead it would be cool
en_026611	10	1	black :: If the doghouse is black, it will absorb more energy then the other colors. This is apparent in the test, where the st arting temperature for the glass jar was 24(DEG) C, and the black jar we nt up to 53(DEG) C, while the white jar only went up to 42(DEG) C.
en_026617	10	1	black :: If you had a dog house black then all the the rmal enegy will go to it and be warmer for your dog. Inside the dog house would be warm for your dog to live in. As it shows in the data black was with the highest temperture.
en_026619	10	1	dark gray :: dark gray because the temperature wont be to hot or to cold it would be just the right temperature for the dog.
en_026620	10	1	light gray ::  The light gray only attracts 45 degrees celci us and that is pretty warm. During the winter the dog won't freeze and du ring the summer it won't sweat a lot.
en_026633	10	1	black :: They should paint the dog house black because that on avergage had the highest temperature of 53(DEG)C. Which was 5(DEG) C higher than the second warmest roof color of Dark Gray and 11(DEG)C higher t han the coldest roof color, white.
en_026642	10	1	black :: white because it was less heat in 10min. Also the temputers only got to around 40- 45(DEG)
en_026645	10	1	black ::  in the summer it can make the inside of the d og house hot.
en_026653	10	2	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their dog house light gray because it won't absorb as much heat/energy as the darker colors. In the data is shows that the black lid got the hottest (53(DEG) C) , while the light gray lid only reached 45(DEG) C. It will still collect heat to keep the doghouse warm but not as much as the darker colors.
en_026658	10	2	white :: The paint color that they should use is white . This is because the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG), while the average temperatures for the other colors were 45, 48, and 53(DEG) . This shows that the white lid was 11(DEG) degrees color on average than the black lid. Therefore, the dog would stay cooler and more comfortable in t he white house, wheras he could become too hot in the black one.
en_026672	10	1	white :: The best color to paint a doghouse is white because white keeps the doghouse less warmer
en_026675	10	2	white :: The color white will effect the inside of the doghouse because it will keep it cooler in the summer when it hot. For example, when the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to abou t 42(DEG)C but when the black lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 53(DEG)C.
en_026682	10	1	black ::  The color will keep the doghouse temperature warmer. The black color will absorb the heat of the day and keep the dogh ouse warm at night.
en_026687	10	2	light gray :: The light gray will make the dogs house not t oo cold and not too hot for the dog. The average tempature would probably be around 40-50(DEG) because the light gray lid on the jar had an avera ge 45(DEG) C but a dog house is a different size from a jar so the tempa ture will vary a little.
en_026690	10	0	white :: White is the best color for the dog house bec ause darker colors absorb more heat when its warm or hot out. But white r eflects all of that heat energy
en_026691	10	2	dark gray :: The reason that I selected dark gray as the o ptimal color for the doghouse is becauseout of all the colors, dark gray seemed to be the middle tempurature. This tempurature will affect the dog house by making it hotter in the winter when the sun shines on it, and c ooler then black in the summer, because it is a lighter shade than black. This will occur from the dark gray paint, because in the experiment, the use of the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 53(DEG). The use of a white lid in the experiment made the air tempur ature inside the jar an average of 42(DEG). The use of a light gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 45(DEG), and the u se of a dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48(DEG). T his shows that dark gray is the middle tempurature, and ideal for a dogho use, because its tempurature was 6(DEG) hotter than the coolest tempurat ure, and 5(DEG) cooler then the hottest tempurature, making dark gray me dium in tempurature, and optimal for a dog house.
en_026693	10	2	white :: The best paint color for the dog house is whi te because the white color for the lid does not get as hot as the other c olor so itt wont be really hot inside the dog house. Acording to the Air Temperature BLACK average was 53 C(DEG) DARK GRAY average 48 C(DEG) LIG HT GRAY average 45 C(DEG) And the WHITE average 42 C(DEG)
en_026696	10	2	black ::  This color (black) will help the dog house stay/become warmer. Since the dog house is outside, and for the most part its pretty cold outside, the dog house should be black, so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm. Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees Celcius. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees Celcius. So this proves that the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb, making the object warmer.
en_026708	10	2	white ::  It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature. It was 42(DEG)C, 43(DEG)C, 41(DEG)C, and 42(DEG)C.
en_026711	10	0	black ::  Black might affect it because the darker the color the the more energy it absorbs.
en_026712	10	0	light gray :: they would choose light gray because they want the dog house to be the right tempature for the dog to stay in without being to hot and light gray is the perfect temapture for the dog.
en_026714	10	1	black ::  black if you live in a cold place and want th e dog house to stay warm.
en_026716	10	1	black ::  In the summer the dog house will be hot but in the winter the dog house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat.
en_026720	10	2	dark gray :: I think that Brandi and Jerry should use dark grey for the dog house paint color.Dark grey would keep the temperature between the highest and the lowest temperature.Dark grey would be the bes t because the black dog house would get to hot for the dog at an average at 53(DEG)c and the white dog house would be to cold for the dog at an a verage of 42(DEG)c so i picked the dark grey dog house because it was in the middle at 48(DEG)c. The light grey house would be my next choise at an average of 45(DEG)c.The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3(DEG)c away from each other and i picked the dark grey because if it g ot colder the dog house would still stay warm enough for the dog.
en_026724	10	1	light gray ::  light gray is not too cold but not too hot . Remember , most dogs have alot of hair on their bodys to keep them warm. &amp; so you dont want a dog house that gets too hot , like the black dog house , cause the sun obsorbs in darker colors. If a dog gets too col d in the dog house , provide blankets , food , &amp; water . For a health y envoirment. Also , if you see its a nice day outside , let the dog play aroud dont make it get cooped up inside .
en_026726	10	1	white ::  i choose white because black and grays suck in alot of heat and white reflects it so white is less hot.
en_026743	10	1	white :: the darker the coler the hotter the air in th e dog house
en_026749	10	2	light gray ::  black absorbs more heat, therefore it will be too warm in the dog house, white on the other hand absorbs less heat as you can see on the data table. During trial 1 white was 42(DEG) while black was 54(DEG). So if the roof is white the dog will too cool. Therefore th e dog house should be light grey, it is a happy medium. On cool days it w ill still be warm because grey absorbs more heat than white, and on hot d ays it wont be too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black.
en_026751	10	1	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse dark gray, then when the dog would be inside the doghouse it would not be hot, but it would not be cold, either. From the investigation for the air temperature, the average of all the averages combined is 47. The closest color to that temperature is dark grey. Therefore, the color dark grey is just the right temperature because it's not too not, and not too cold. The dog inside the doghouse would be perfect in this temperature.

en_026789	10	1	light gray :: it would affect the dog house by keeping it cool. A dog that is active and does a lot of running, the dog would not want to got to a doghouse that is painted black because that would attract a lot of heat to the point where the dog would stay too hot to cool off.
en_026799	10	2	white :: by painting the doghouse white it would make the doghouse cooler inside than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the data it shows that the average temperature of the air in the jar that had the white lid was 42(DEG)c , and the average temprature for the air inside the jar that had the black lid was 53(DEG)c. by painting the doghouse white there would be a difference in heat of 11(DEG)c t han painting the doghouse black. therefore painting the doghouse white would be the best choice of color to paint the doghouse because it would keep it the coolist temperature.
en_026800	10	2	white ::  If the doghouse is white, it will not become as hot as if it were painted black. The jar with the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C under the lamp. However, the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C
en_026804	10	1	white ::  The white would make it cooler inside so in t he summer it wouldn't be hot
en_026805	10	2	white ::  You should use white because the dog probibly has enough fur to last through winer so you would want to keep as much h eat out as possible during the summer-I say this because according to the test reasults the average air heat from black was 53(DEG)C, the average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C, The average for light gray was 45(DEG)C an d the average for white was 42(DEG)C. So in conclution the white paint i s 11(DEG)C cooler than black paint. -

en_027115	10	0	black :: The color my affect the dog house because the dog might not be the same color as the house or the house will be to dar k because its black.
en_027119	10	0	white :: black and gray obsorb the color $
en_027123	10	2	white :: This color will make the air in the doghouse less hot, so the dog will be a lot cooler while in the doghouse. I know t his because in the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid and coo lest with a white one. So if the sun is beating down on the doghouse, it will only reach about 42(DEG) C, instead of 45(DEG) C or higher.
en_027124	10	1	white :: Color will affect the doghouse because if the house is painted black it will get very hot inside but if it is white it will say cool allowing for the dog to be comftrable in side
en_027128	10	1	dark gray :: the dark gray with make the house be warm not to coldnor to hot. the data shows that the dark gray is always 48(DEG)C so you dont have to worry about the temperature getting clder ar hotter.
en_027136	10	1	black :: it will make the inside of the doghouse warme r for the dog because dark colors obsorb more heat then light color s as shown in the investigation.
en_027142	10	0	white :: WHite dosent absorb much energy compared to b lack. black absorbs the energy like crazy
en_027146	10	1	white :: I choise white because white would keep the d oghouse cool in the summer.
en_027157	10	2	black ::  if you choose a black color for your dog hous e the tempature would be warmer than if you used a white color, because t he air inside the jar with the black lid was warmer than the lighter colo rs
en_027166	10	1	white :: white would make the doghouse less hot on a s unny day making it a place where the dog can cool down.
en_027175	10	1	black :: I chose black, because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer and lay in the shade or run through water-sprinklers; and in the winter, the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog to sleep comfortably inside (the energy from the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the doghouse).
en_027180	10	1	dark gray :: The dark grey will make it so it isnt to hott in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house.
en_027183	10	1	black ::  i chose black because it was the color that kept the jar the hottest degree C(DEG).
en_027184	10	0	white ::  tha color will atract so much heat
en_027199	10	2	dark gray ::  I think that if you choose a color to dark, then it might make the dog really hot, so I would choose dark gray because it won't very hot or very cold. Dark gray has trials that are 48(DEG) C which is hot. However, it is not as hot as the color of black with the highest temperture of 54(DEG) and it's also not as cold as the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41(DEG). So Dark gray would be a good color for a dog house.
en_027202	10	0	white :: because the white will not atract that much h eat like the other colors.
en_027203	10	2	white :: because white does not obsorb as much heat as black, the dog house will be cooler. the white lid reached an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black one.
en_027207	10	2	black ::  The black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house. In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius. For the lowest color, white, it was 42 degrees celcius. This means that the black was 11 celcius warmer than the white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up t he house.
en_027215	10	0	dark gray :: I picked Dark grey because it will be consistantly 48(DEG)c i know because in the table For each trial it was 48(DEG)c.
en_027216	10	2	light gray :: Light gray would keep the inside of the dogho use from becoming to hot, and it would still be a better color than white for cold nights. This is true because the average temperature for the bl ack lid was 53(DEG)C, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG)C
en_027230	10	0	light gray ::  it would keep the dog house at a good temp. the entire year round.
en_027234	10	0	white :: Because if you have a dog house and you paint it a white it will be a light grey inside the dog house and so from tha t the dog house will be a nice shade of white with a light coat of grey o n the inside of the doghouse and if the dog house is a square thier will be a perfect color on the d og house.
en_027249	10	2	white ::  The color white would be a good color for a d oghouse because it heats up the air in it the least. In the experiment, t he color white only heated up the air in the jar to an average of 42(DEG) C compared to the color black which heated up the air in the jar to an average of 53(DEG)C.
en_027255	10	1	white ::  the white was the coldest and most dogs have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be best
en_027262	10	2	black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black. He will be warm inside the black doghouse because the average tempature of the black lid was 53(DEG)C. In the jar with the white lid, the average tempature was 42(DEG)C. It will be 11(DEG)C warmer in the black doghouse than the white one. That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight.
en_027268	10	0	black :: the darker color obsorbs more heat so it woul d bi a good dog house
en_027273	10	1	black :: the solor energy (sun) will be attracted to the black paint, to make the inside temperature of the doghouse increase.
en_027275	10	2	light gray :: the color of the doghouse might affect the in side of the doghouse by the temperature inside. As shown in the data tab le of the experiment, the data shows that the average temperature is 45(DEG) C which when comapared to other temperatures it shows that it is not lowest or the highest its in the middle.
en_027277	10	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse because it's not too hot and it's not too cold. The average temperature would be 48(DEG) C. Just right.
en_027279	10	1	white ::  The color white might affect the dog house be caus lighter colors reflect light.
en_027281	10	2	black ::  i pick black because black is a dark color an d and darker colors atract energy (like heat).so that way the inside of t he dog house will be worm.like for the black lid all the results were 54 and all the other colors were 10(DEG) and less.
en_027296	10	2	white :: White will keep the dog house cool on a hot s ummer day more than a darker color such as black. white was on averge 11(DEG) c cooler than black.
en_027297	10	1	black :: Since dark colors capture more heat, use black for color to help keep doghouse warm.
en_027309	10	1	white ::  i think that if you use a white paint then th e dog house will be nice a cool because if you use black the dog would ge t hot so that why you shuld use white.
en_027317	10	2	white ::  Painting the doghouse white would ensure that the dog doesn't get too hot while it's inside. White would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler than any other color. I know this because in the experiment, the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was less than any other colored lid.
en_027319	10	2	white ::  By painting the dog house white, it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler. This is proven because in each trial, white had the lowest temperature. For example, in the experiment, White's average tempurate was 42(DEG), compared to black's average, which was 53(DEG); a huge difference!
en_027334	10	0	white :: i think that white is a good color because he at will not be attracted as fast and white is a really nice color.
en_027356	10	2	black :: If they paint the dog house black the conditi ons in the house would be hot because the jar was the hottest when they p ut the black lid on the jar. So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color.
en_027358	10	1	:: its depends on were they live if its a hot pl ace then a white dog house but if its a cold place then a black dog house to make the doghouse a little warmer and in the middle if its a mixture.
en_027362	10	2	light gray ::  Dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold. The results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42(DEG)C. In the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well. Black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53(DEG)C. However, even though according to the experiment,the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool. The experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid, but only by 3(DEG)C, therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5(DEG)C cooler than the jar with the black lid. The dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer, but remain warm in the winter.
en_027364	10	0	black ::  because that way the dog wont be hot or cold, it would not be cold but it wont be hot eighter.
en_027365	10	2	black :: Black will absorb more heat, therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year. the average temperature inside the ja r with a black lid was 53 degrees Celcius, while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower.
en_027368	10	2	black ::  The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter. The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors. The experiment results show that black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54(DEG)c and the coldest for black was 52(DEG)c. The least warmest was the color white. The highest temperature was 43(DEG)c. the lowest was 41(DEG)c. I chose black because it will keep the dog the warmest in the cold winter. White would not be as warm as black is.
en_027377	10	1	black ::  IT WILLBE HOTTER COSE ITS HOT
en_027379	10	1	light gray ::  it might be less hot than a darker lid becaus e black absorbes the most heat.
en_027400	10	2	white ::  White paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins. under the light it was the coldest with an average of 42o, 11 degrees colder than the hottest pai nt color of black the average of the black paint's air was 53.
en_027415	10	1	white :: white absorbs less heat so it would keep the dog cooler
en_027420	10	0	white :: porque es el que da mas inside de glass
en_027424	10	0	black :: Black, because on a warm day the dog house would heat up but it wouldnt be too hot for the dog. And on a cold day the dog house should be the same tempature ( 53(DEG) C ) or get a little col der, but not to cold for the animal.
en_027427	10	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse. Light gray had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't b e too cold or too warm for a dog. A white doghouse was 42 degrees which m ight make the dog cold and black and dark gray would make the dog too war m. Dark grays average was 48 and blacks average was 53, much too warm.The refore light gray would be the best color.
en_027430	10	2	white :: I would pick white paint to paint the dog hou se because according to the experiment white was the color that the insid e of the jar would be less hot. Accordig to Brandi and Jerry's data the w hite lid had a temperature 42(DEG)C inside the jar and the black lid was 53(DEG)C and i dont want my dog to be to hot or sufficate in the dog ho use.
en_027432	10	1	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry colored the doghouse white, it would not asorb the heatness like the color black. Therefore, it would feel more comfortable for the dog when it is hot outside. The reason why black was to asorb heat, because in the data table it had higher degree then white, which had a lowest degree in temperature.
en_027434	10	1	black :: Black would be a good color for the dog house because in the day it would get hotter because black absorbs heat causin g it to be warmer in their at night.
en_027435	10	2	black :: We can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat. Knowing this information, for the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse, Brandi and Jerry should paint the house Black.
en_027437	10	2	white ::  They should use white paint because when the sun comes out the doghouse won't get as much heat absorbed. As shown in t he table the darker lid they used the hotter the air became and white is the lightest color used and it had the lowest temperature.
en_027438	10	2	dark gray ::  The color will effect the dog house by keepin g it the same temperature which would be cool in the summer and warm in t he winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar t he same temperature for all 3 trials; which the average temperature was 48(DEG)C.
en_027444	10	0	black :: 1:The dog will be feeling like fanetting. 2:The dog will gett thirsty. 3:The dog will breath reeally hard.
en_027445	10	0	white ::  The color should keep the inside of the dog house at a reasonable temperature. Based on the results from the experiment, the hypothesis was right about black soaking up heat through the black rather than white. So the white paint would work the same by keeping the heat under control and not letting it all in.
en_027458	10	1	black :: this color would keep the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract heat from the son.
en_027462	10	0	black :: they sould use black because black keeps heat better than the other colors so the dont want there dog to get cold so b lack is the most affective color.
en_027479	10	1	black ::  The color black because it would be warm in t he doghouse. Since black absorbs more heat black would be best to keep th e dog warm rather than cold.

en_027515	10	1	black ::  The color black would make the house warmer o n the inside.
en_027521	10	1	dark gray :: dark grey will make the dog house warm inside but it wont get to hot for the dog. in the jar the air tempature insde t he jar with the dark grey lid stayed at 48. there for in the dog house it wont be to cold or to hot it will be warm
en_027531	10	2	white ::  The color white wouldn't absorb as much ener gy as the darker colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm. With a black lid, the jar was an average temperture was 53(DEG) C after 10 minu tes. With the White lid the temperature was an average of 42(DEG) C. Thi s shows that the lighter the color, the less heat you will have trampted inside the dog house. Something to warm would not be suitable for a dog, and therefore making white the right color.
en_027535	10	1	light gray ::  Based on the data I think light grey would be the best color. I think that because it would make the doghouse warm fo r the winter but it wont be too hot in the summer.
en_027544	10	2	white ::  The color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it won't be to hot for the dog. As shown in the data white is the coolest. The average for a black lid is 53(DEG) C. The dark gray lid is 48(DEG) C the light gray lid is 45(DEG) C and the white lid is 42(DEG) C. Therefore the white is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog.
en_027545	10	1	white :: With a white doghouse the dog will be cool when the weather is warm/ hot because the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter because there is not much heat to absorb anyway so it would not matter how dark the paint is.
en_027553	10	2	white :: The color white had the lowist temp at the en d of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors
en_027565	10	1	light gray :: the color wouyld affect the dog house in this way in the heat the dog would stay cool but its not so light that it wou ld be cold for him in the winter. so keeping it at a light darker color y ou ahve a mixeture of the 2.
en_027568	10	2	light gray ::  it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an a verage of 45(DEG)Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3(DEG)Celsius making an 8(DEG)Celsius difference between the two.
en_027579	10	1	black :: because black absorbs heat more then the othe r colors
en_027580	10	1	white :: The color white absorbs less heat therefore w ill reduce the impact the sun has on the temperature inside the doghouse.
en_027586	10	1	light gray :: i think light gray would work the best becaus e,if its hot outside the house will manage to stay cool inside,and in the winter it will manage to stay warm inside.
